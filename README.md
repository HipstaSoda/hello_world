# hello_world

Sup, I'm the Hipsta Soda, I'm currently using GitHub because I want to learn how to use Code or Coffeescript or Java.
Anyway I've been playing Rainbow Six Siege, and Minecraft lately but I generally enjoy the some Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout, also the Halo games but not including Halo 5 or 4,I also enjoy COD Black Ops 1 and 2.
I'm only saying this because the guide told me to, later nerds.
